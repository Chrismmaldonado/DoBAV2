# Implementation Notes: Optimizing Fact Retrieval System

## Overview
This document outlines the changes made to optimize the fact retrieval system, autonomous system, and self-learning system to be more efficient and capable of handling intensive tasks without token overload.

## Key Issues Addressed
1. **Duplicate Code**: Multiple identical implementations of `nuclear_extract_facts` method in DobAEI.py
2. **Token Usage**: Excessive token usage in fact retrieval and conversation history
3. **Performance**: Inefficient search patterns in fact retrieval

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. SQLiteNuclearMemory.recall_facts
- Reduced search scope to only category and key fields (not values) to focus on most relevant facts
- Limited results to 5 facts (down from 10)
- Truncated fact values to 100 characters to reduce token usage

### 2. SQLiteNuclearMemory.get_diverse_conversations
- Reduced limit from 40 to 20 conversations
- Truncated messages to 150 characters to reduce token usage

### 3. IntelligentMemoryManager.retrieve_intelligent_facts
- Reduced limit from 40 to 20 facts
- Allocated limits proportionally across different search methods (semantic, AI, tag-based)
- Added explicit limit enforcement on final results

### 4. TrueConsensusBigAGI.nuclear_recall_facts
- Limited keywords to top 3 for efficiency
- Added more targeted approach for personal information queries
- Removed unnecessary formatting to reduce tokens

### 5. search_relevant_conversations
- Added stop word filtering to focus on meaningful keywords
- Implemented scoring system based on keyword matches
- Reduced return limit from 10 to 5 conversations

### 6. nuclear_extract_facts (Consolidated Implementation)
- Created a single optimized implementation that:
  - Checks if text contains personal information before extraction
  - Truncates long text to reduce token usage
  - Uses a more focused prompt for extraction
  - Skips empty or very long values
  - Tracks and reports extraction statistics
  - Accepts an optional memory parameter for better testability

## Implementation Details
The optimized `nuclear_extract_facts` method is provided in `optimized_nuclear_extract_facts.py`. This implementation should replace all duplicate implementations in DobAEI.py.

## Testing
A test script (`test_optimized_extraction.py`) was created to verify the optimized implementation. The tests confirm that:
1. Non-personal information is correctly skipped
2. Personal facts are properly extracted
3. The method works with both the default and custom memory instances

## Next Steps
1. Replace all duplicate implementations of `nuclear_extract_facts` in DobAEI.py with the optimized version
2. Consider further optimizations to other memory-intensive operations
3. Monitor token usage after implementation to verify improvements
